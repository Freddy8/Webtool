            Dear DealerCenter<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;I would be grateful if you would consider my website for the position interviewed.
            Please be informed that I recently created this website to further demonstrates my value.
            During my interview, we spoke about how the job will require me to identify issues independent
            dealerships face today and find the right solution for their business. So, I decided to create a
            web-tool based on the problems the dealership is facing. Dealership owners will then see how DealerCenter
            could help, by showing them the features they value most right away, which will allow them to determine the
            right products for their business needs quickly.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Also, keeping tracking of the issues the dealership has will help during the sales demo and with client
            retention. The sales demo will be structured based on the problems the client is having and how they can get back
            on track with the right products. This increases client retention because they will not be paying for products
            they donâ€™t value.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;This web-tool demonstrates my understanding of the bigger picture at DealerCenter & Nowcom.
            With the right technology and business solutions, clients will have a competitive advantage.
            I am very enthusiastic about taking new responsibilities with bigger operations and significant
            challenges. I am a fast learner and can adapt to new situations, from door to door sales,
            prospecting, internet sales, telemarketing, and relationship building. I was able to generate
            success with every responsibility.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Hence, I am ready to move forward with a new career opportunity in your organization,
            where my sales background, technical skills, and personal skills will allow me the chance of
            growth with your organization. Look forward to working with your esteemed organization.<br>
            <br>
            Best wishes,<br>
            Federico Castellanos
