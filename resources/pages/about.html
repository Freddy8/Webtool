            Dear<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;I shoud be greatful if you would consider my website for the postion interviewed.
            Please be informed that I recently created this website to futhur demonstrates my value.
            During my interview we spoke about how the position will require me to identify issues
            independent dealerships face today and find the right solution for their business. So, I
            decided to create a web-tool were based on the issue the dealership is facing they will see
            how DealerCenter could help, by showing them the features they value most right away.
            This will help them quickly determine the right products for their business needs.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Also, by keeping tracking of the issues the dealership has, will help during the sales
            demo and with client retention. This means structuring the sales demo based on the issues the
            client is having and how we could get them back on track with the right products. While,
            increasing client retention because they are not paying for products they donâ€™t value.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;This web-tool demonstrates my understanding of the bigger picture at DealerCenter & Nowcom.
            That with the right technology and business solutions, clients will have a competitive advantage.
            I am very enthusiastic to take new responsibilities with bigger operations and high
            challenges. I am a fast learner and can adapt to new situations, from door to door sales, prospecting,
            internet sales, telemarketing, and relationship building. I was able to generate success with every
            responsiblity.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Hence, I am ready to move forward with a new career opportunity in your organization,
            where my sales background, technical skills and personnel skills will allow me the opportunity
            of growth with your organization. Look forward to working with your esteemed organization.<br>
            <br>
            Best wishes,<br>
            Federico Castellanos
