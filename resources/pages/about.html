            Dear DealerCenter<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;I should be grateful if you would consider my website for the position interviewed.
             Please be informed that I recently created this website to further demonstrates my value.
             During my interview, we spoke about how the job will require me to identify issues independent
             dealerships face today and find the right solution for their business. So, I decided to create a web-tool
             based on the problems the dealership is facing. They will then see how DealerCenter could help. By showing
             them the features, they value most right away, which allows them to determine the right products for
             their business needs quickly.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Also, keeping tracking of the issues the dealership has will help during the sales demo and with
            client retention, which will help when structuring the sales demo based on the problems the client is
            having and how we could get them back on track with the right products. While also increasing client
            retention because they are not paying for products they donâ€™t value.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;This web-tool demonstrates my understanding of the bigger picture at DealerCenter & Nowcom.
            That with the right technology and business solutions, clients will have a competitive advantage.
            I am very enthusiastic about taking new responsibilities with bigger operations and significant
            challenges. I am a fast learner and can adapt to new situations, from door to door sales,
            prospecting, internet sales, telemarketing, and relationship building. I was able to generate
            success with every responsibility.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Hence, I am ready to move forward with a new career opportunity in your organization,
            where my sales background, technical skills, and personal skills will allow me the chance of
            growth with your organization. Look forward to working with your esteemed organization.
            <br>
            Best wishes,<br>
            Federico Castellanos
